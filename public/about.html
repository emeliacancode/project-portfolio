<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr size="3"/>

<p>My name is Emelia Ossai and I was born in Monrovia, Liberia ( West Africa). Due to an extended civil war that 
  started in Liberia in 1989, I eventaully migrated to the United States in 1991. From Then, altough I've lived in 
  various states, I've been fortunate to call the wonderful state of Georgia my home away from home. I love to travel and
  experience different cultures. I love learning new things and learning from interactions with others. In my spare time,
  if there is water nearby, I want to jump right in it. Until then, I like to marvel at the beauty of creation an ask,
  "How can I contribute?"</p>

<p>I am an operations and project professional with over 12 years of experience in the core field area of 
  supply chain. I have a degree in Managerial Sciences from GA state University with a focus in the areas 
  of Supply Chain and Marketing. I have worked with companies of various sizes--- From large corporate 
  enterprises to small start-ups. Over the years I have made it a point to build my skills and gain experience
  in a variety of different fields to ensure I, not only maintain competency in the roles of project 
  management and Supply chain, but also provide consistent value for my employer. In my most recent role as
  a project manager, I worked to seek out areas of opportunity for projects that will enhance business 
  presence and brand recognition which ultimately had a positive impact on market growth. In past roles,
  Iâ€™ve worked with suppliers, negotiated contract terms and conditions, as well as assessed market trends 
  to establish profitable long-term relationships. Those experiences as well as others have given me the 
  opportunity to develop myself as a project and sourcing strategist.</p>


<p>For as far as I can remember, IT has had a significant impact on my life. I can recall giving a speech in 7th grade
  about the impact of computer on our everyday lives, and at that time yahoo mail wasn't even a thing for me yet.
  Looking back on that speech... I can only say that we were beginning to write the letter A when it comes to
  impact that technology has and will eventually have on our everyday lives. As I become fully immersed into the 
  world of technology and soak upoo all of its possibilities.... I have buckled up in preparation for a remarkable and unpredictable 
  ride.</p>
